This app lets you report alien encounters on Mars, uses Angulars Http service to get and post data to the API.
It lets a user enter their information as a Colonist, choose a job, view previous alien encounters and submit a new encounter.

## The Tools:

1. Angular 2
2. Angular CLI
3. routerLink 
4. ES6 written in TypeScript
5. GET & POST requests using the Angular Http service
6. HTML5 / CSS3
7. ng server

## Summary

It is interesting that Angular2 uses components to construct an app similar to react.js but it's different in many ways. Which makes endless possiblities to create apps.
